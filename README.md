## Concept

This time Team Zircon has been commissioned to create a framework for a single-player RogueLike game. The aim of the project is to offer a highly flexible and extensible framework for this type of game which includes generation of levels (possibility of random generation), turn-based gameplay, an inventory, generation of monsters and more. A player will be able to progress in various maps with different levels of difficulty. The main goal is to make sure that any enhancement to a game using the framework could be made easy thanks to the implementation of the architectural and design patterns.
